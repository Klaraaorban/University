desc: 	- the function iterates trough the hashtabel
	- if element is found then (i,j) are the positions of the given element
	- otherwise: throw exception

pre: 	- matrix exists
	- i and j are integers which hold the positions of the element
	- e is the element
 
post: 	- if e found (i,j) are the positions
	- if e found no throws

best case: 	theta(1)
average case: 	theta(n)
worst case:	theta(n)
gesamt:		O(n)
